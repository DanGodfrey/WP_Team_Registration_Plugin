Description: 

Team_Registration is a WordPress Plugin designed to handle team registration for tournaments. 

A normal user can create a team for a tournament, join an existing team, and manage the members on a team if they are the creator of said team.

Team_Registration includes admin tools that can be accessed from the WordPress admin panel. An admin can, add and delete tournaments. A tournament contains:
	
		-Name: the name that will appear to users
		-Team Size: the maximum number of people that can be on a given team in the tournament
		-Max Number of Teams: the maximum number of teams allowed to enter the tournament

Team_Registration was originally designed to be used for Battle Royale IV (www.battleroyale.ca), Ottawa's largest LAN Party!
